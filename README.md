# Plex Auto Languages

Plex Auto Languages enhances your Plex experience by automatically updating the audio and subtitle settings of TV shows based on your preferences. Similar to Netflix, it remembers your language preferences for each TV show without interfering with your global settings or other users' preferences.

## Features

- **Seamless Language Selection**: Watch *Squid Game* in Korean with English subtitles? Just set it once for the first episode and enjoy the rest of the series hassle-free. üëå
- **Per-Show Customization**: Want *The Mandalorian* in English and *Game of Thrones* in French? Preferences are tracked separately for each show. ‚úîÔ∏è
- **Multi-User Support**: Perfect for households with diverse preferences. Each user gets their tracks automatically and independently selected. ‚úîÔ∏è
